Experimentation and innovation!

Hello! 

My name is Josh and I'm currently a student in college right now at Bowdoin College!
I have never used GitHub before, but I am looking forward to figuring out how to use it. 
My main experience with programming is in Python 3, but now I'm most comfortable using Java.
